# ChatPrintr
A pretty-printer for (for now) WhatsApp chats.

**This is still a work in progress.**

Hi. This is a little script for pretty-printing long WhatsApp conversations you'd like to send to someone, like stitching together multiple screenshots of the coversation.

This was inspired by the default ugly WhatsApp message copypasta and the cumbersome process of taking multiple screenshots for a single conversation.

This works only on Python2.7, since I plan on porting it to Flask, which too only supports Python2.7 currently.

**About the files:**
* `timeName.py`: The actual Python script
* `timeName.sh`: For testing regexes
* `chat.txt`: A WhatsApp copypasta for testing

# To-do List
* Add the timestamps
* Make the web app
* Make it graphically more accurate to the WhatsApp UI
